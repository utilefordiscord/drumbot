## ðŸ‘‹ Drumbot wants you!

Drumbot loves drum machines so much that she made an API dedicated to them.<br>
Miscord also loves music, but she isn't very good when it comes to creating music patterns.

So, [**@tilda**](https://github.com/tilda) has made an API wrapper for Python for Miscord and Drumbot to work together!

## Installation
In the nature of open-source, installation of this API wrapper is obviously permitted, but we really see no point why would someone want to use this.<br><br>
As we can't do anything to stop you, to install run the following command:
```
cd drumbot && chmod +x setup.py && ./setup.py
```

## API
Drumbot's API has the following methods:

```GET /drumbot/patterns```

Returns the list of available patterns

```GET /drumbot/patterns/{pattern-name}```

Returns a pattern.

See the [API documention](https://github.com/utilefordiscord/drumbot-implementation/blob/master) for all the details!
